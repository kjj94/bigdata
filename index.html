          <p id="text1-a" class="maintext"> In 2019, <span class="highlight"> the World Food Programme (WFP) collected data about households in the Northern Triangle </span>, across El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. While migration may be perceived as an individual endeavor,the reality is of course that migration is often vital for survival of entire families. <span class="highlight"> Migration affects entire households.</span> It affects <span class="highlight">elderly such as Pedro and Marta</span> who rely on remittances from their children, <span class="highlight">single-mothers such as Maria</span> who survive off of her brother’s work at Mcdonald’s, and the ability for adults such as <span class="highlight">Juan who lives in an 18-person household</span> to complete their education. So, how exactly is the household as a whole affected by migration?
  </p>
<p class= "maintext"> Our main questions were: <br> - What is the link between <span class="highlight"> migration and household size</span>?
<br> - How does it affect <span class="highlight"> education</span> within families?
<br> - How does migration affect <span class="highlight"> income sufficiency </span>?
</span></p>

          <h2 id=text2-0 class ="maintext"> 01 Household Overview</h2>
          <p id="text1-a" class="maintext"> Our analysis uses data from the WFP survey, with <span class="highlight">each bubble representing one household </span> in the Northern Triangle, the <span class="highlight">size of the bubble correlating to household size</span> (1-18 people.) Here, we have visualized <span class="highlight">almost 5,000 households </span>, encompassing <span class="highlight">over 20,000 individuals </span>.
  </p>
          <p id="text2-b" class="maintext"> These visualisations all represent real people with different stories:<br>
             - <span class="highlight"> Pedro</span>, a 62-year old man living in San Rafael Pie de la Cuesta, Guatemala, is able to sustain his life with his wife, from <span class="highlight">money that their kids send</span> on a monthly basis. <br>
            - <span class="highlight"> Maria </span>, a 21-year old single mother living in San Francisco Javier, El Salvador, receives her main source of income from a <span class="highlight">brother who works at Mcdonald’s</span> in a neighboring city.

          <h2 id=text3-0 class ="maintext"> 02 Country </h2>
          <p id="text3-a" class="maintext"> Households are located all across the Northern Triangle. In relation to our data, <span class="highlight">34.6% live in Guatemala</span>, <span class="highlight">31.4% live in Honduras</span>, and <span class="highlight">34% live in El Salvador</span>. Within these countries, households are located across urban and rural areas, with 68% living in rural areas and 32% living in urban areas.   </p>

          <h2 id=text3-0 class ="maintext"> 03 External Migration</h2>
          <p id="text3-a" class="maintext"> Migration in our dataset is certainly an anomaly, not the norm. Here, we can see that <span class="highlight">over 76 percent of households do not have any migrants</span> in their family in the last five years. In contrast, only <span class="highlight">24 percent of households have at least one family member that has migrated externally</span> in the last five years. External migration remains the minority.

They have <span class="highlight">three family members who have migrated in the last five years</span>. Looking into these households, we begin to see that <span class="highlight">as household size</span> increases, the <span class="highlight">likelihood of migration</span> within families <span class="highlight">also increases</span>.   </p>

          <h2 id=text3-0 class ="maintext"> 05 Education</h2>
          <p id="text3-a" class="maintext"> <span class="highlight">Carmen</span>, A <span class="highlight">27-year old bi-parental mother</span> with six household members from Barrio Paz y Desarrollo, Guatemala, does not have anyone in her family who has migrated.

          <p id="text3-b" class="maintext"> Looking at the effects of migration, we can see that <span class="highlight">families with migrants tend to have a much higher maximum educational level</span> achieved- 39.6% have a general/technical baccalaureate within their family, versus 33.1 percent for families without external migration. Does external migration lead to higher education? While correlation/causation cannot be deduced, it is clear that migration has a stabilizing force for education.

                <p id="text3-b" class="maintext"> As shown in the graph, families with migrants are much more likely to have “enough” income than those without migrants (20.1% versus 13.9%.)

                <p id="text3-b" class="maintext"> <span class="highlight">Remittances</span> are also a <span class="highlight">big part of the primary source of income</span>- <span class="highlight">one-fifth of families with migrants say their primary source of income comes from migrant remittances</span> from abroad. <span class="highlight">Even for households without any external migration, migrant remittances still make up five percent of primary source of income</span> for these families.Does external migration lead to greater income sufficiency? While correlation/causation cannot be deduced, remittances are a major source of income for many households, and can help move families from insufficient to enough income.    </p>

            <p id="text3-a" class="maintext"> In conclusion, <span class="highlight">Pedro, Maria, Juan, Carmen, and Ana</span> are all individuals across the Northern Triangle that have been <span class="highlight">impacted by migration to varying degrees</span>. By looking at the effects of migration through households as a collective unit, we begin to understand the prevalence and importance of migration for education and income. When thinking about policy, <span class="highlight">it is important to consider the households well beyond the singular, individual migrant</span>. Migration affects entire households, and <span class="highlight">policy should be discussed in terms of the relation to entire households</span>.
