While migration may be perceived as an individual endeavor,the reality is of course that migration is often vital for survival of entire families. <span class="highlight"> Migration affects entire households. </span> Here, we have visualized <span class="highlight">almost 5,000 households </span>, encompassing <span class="highlight">over 20,000 individuals </span>.

By looking at the effects of migration through households as a collective unit, we begin to understand the prevalence and importance of migration for education and income. When thinking about policy, <span class="highlight">it is important to consider the households well beyond the singular, individual migrant</span>. Migration affects entire households, and <span class="highlight">policy should be discussed in terms of the relation to their entire households</span>.
